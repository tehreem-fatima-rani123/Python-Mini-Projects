# 25 Python Projects for Beginners - Easy Ideas to Get Started Coding Python

The best way to learn a new programming language is to build projects with it.

I have created a list of 25 beginner-friendly project tutorials in Python.

## How to Approach These Projects

1. Watch the tutorial video.
2. Build the project step by step.
3. Break it apart and rebuild it in your own way.
4. Experiment by adding new features or using different methods.

This approach will help you test whether you truly understand the concepts.
